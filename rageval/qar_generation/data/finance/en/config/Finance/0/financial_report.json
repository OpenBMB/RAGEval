Firstly, in January 2018, the company completed the acquisition of a 20% equity stake in Alpha Financial Services. This strategic move not only expanded Capital Finance Group's market share but also enhanced its control in the industry. As a result, the company saw an increase in its operating income, net profit, and total assets.\n\nTo further strengthen its position in the market, Capital Finance Group introduced a series of new investment products in February 2018, including high-yield bonds and structured notes.

The company maintained a debt ratio of 40%, reflecting its debt level in relation to its total assets. The debt to assets ratio stood at 25%, indicating the company's financial leverage. Finally, the return on equity was 10%, reflecting the operational efficiency of shareholder equity.\n\nLooking ahead, Capital Finance Group plans to implement financial strategies focused on cost control and optimizing capital operations to improve profitability and operational efficiency.
