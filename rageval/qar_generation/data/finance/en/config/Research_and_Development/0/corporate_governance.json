This change had a direct impact on the strategic direction of the company. Subsequently, a board meeting was held in February 2017 to discuss future plans and strategic direction. This meeting had implications for the long-term development of InnovaTech Solutions and the interests of its shareholders. In March 2017, a strategic review was conducted to evaluate the company's current market position and competitive advantages.
