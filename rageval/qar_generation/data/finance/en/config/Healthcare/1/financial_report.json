Furthermore, the company achieved significant milestones in the development of its innovative medical technology products in September 2020, showcasing its technological capabilities to potential investors and securing additional funding opportunities.\n\nTo optimize its capital structure, HealthLife Solutions underwent debt restructuring in June 2020, reducing its liabilities by $25 million.
