    "Generated Article": "In 2018, MediaCorp faced several significant governance challenges and implemented various measures to address them. In January, the company experienced ethics and integrity incidents that could potentially damage its reputation and brand value. To prevent future incidents, MediaCorp undertook a comprehensive review and enhancement of its internal controls in the first quarter of 2018.

The impact of these enhanced internal controls is expected to mitigate the risk of future incidents and reinforce the company's commitment to ethics and integrity, enhancing relationships with stakeholders.\n\nIn February, MediaCorp revised its Code of Conduct to explicitly address various ethical aspects, such as fraud, corruption, and conflicts of interest.

The company prioritized regular and comprehensive information disclosure through official statements, press releases, and annual reports. MediaCorp also implemented policies, procedures, and measures to ensure fairness and compliance in related transactions. Additionally, the company established a robust internal control system to ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting, mitigate risks, and safeguard assets.\n\nLooking ahead, MediaCorp has outlined governance improvement plans, including strengthening the function of the board of directors and supervisory board, enhancing transparency and the quality of information disclosure, and establishing a whistleblower program.
