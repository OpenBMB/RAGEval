In 2018, MediaCorp made significant strides in expanding its business and enhancing its market competitiveness. One of the major highlights was the acquisition of Big Pictures, a renowned film production company, in April. This asset acquisition, valued at $100 million, allowed MediaCorp to broaden its business scope and tap into the lucrative film industry.
