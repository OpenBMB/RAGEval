## Case Statement

This court heard the case against G. Torres for the crime of selling counterfeit registered trademark goods between November 2022 and January 2023. The complaint and subsequent investigation revealed that within this period, G. Torres continued the sale of counterfeit items, including handbags branded falsely under names such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Chanel. These items were sold at her retail store where she misrepresented counterfeit goods as genuine, deceiving buyers and damaging the rightful owners' brand reputations.

### Specific Incidents
1. **November 2022 to January 2023**:
   Throughout this stretch, G. Torres sold counterfeit handbags, attracting unsuspecting customers by presenting them as genuine high-end products. Inventory ledgers, receipts, and testimonies from undercover buyers spearheaded the evidence.

2. **1st December 2022**:
   In a significant promotional event labeled 'Best Deal Sale', the defendant explicitly advertised counterfeit goods as authentic items at heavy discounts. Advertising flyers and social media announcements tied to the store's promotions were key evidence used in court.

3. **15th January 2023**:
   On this date, an undercover officer posing as a regular customer purchased several counterfeit items from G. Torres's store. This interaction, recorded and documented through video evidence, significantly bolstered the prosecution's case.

4. **Various Dates from November 2022 to January 2023**:
   G. Torres deliberately continued replenishing her counterfeit stock through known unverified suppliers, despite understanding the illegal nature of these goods. Supplier communications, shipping records, and expert analyses confirmed that these items were counterfeit.

## Charge

G. Torres was charged under Article No. 214 for the Crime of Selling Counterfeit Registered Trademark Goods. The evidence substantiated that she knowingly engaged in the distribution of counterfeit luxury items, misleading consumers and infringing on the trademark rights of the authentic brands.

Numerous transaction receipts found within the store premises verified the high volume of the counterfeit items sold. These receipts, alongside customer testimonials obtained from undercover operations, were crucial in outlining the illegal activities.

### Undercover Purchases and Testimonies

Undercover operations played a pivotal role in solidifying the case. On various occasions, undercover officers managed to make purchases of counterfeit goods which were later introduced as court exhibits. Their witness testimonies highlighted the defendant's conscious racket operation and deception towards customers.

### Advertising Evidence

Promotional materials used during the 'Best Deal Sale'—flyers and social media posts—explicitly claimed authenticity of brand products sold at marked-down prices. These materials were retrieved and submitted as evidence, displaying obvious attempts to mislead the public intentionally.

### Supplier Records and Communications

Documents recovered from the store contained communications between G. Torres and her suppliers, detailing orders for counterfeit goods and subsequent shipments. These records, including emails and shipment logs, evidenced her awareness and intent to distribute these illicit items.

### Expert Analysis

Experts in trademark identification and counterfeit analysis were called to testify. They presented findings confirming the counterfeit nature of the goods, reviewing material inconsistencies and design flaws that deviate from authentic brand standards.

## Sentencing Considerations

In determining the sentence for G. Torres, this court considered several crucial factors. These included:

1. **Cooperation with Investigation**:
   During the investigation, G. Torres exhibited a cooperative demeanor, providing access to records and assisting law enforcement in understanding the scope of her activities.

2. **First-time Offense**:
   It was duly noted that this incident represented G. Torres's first offense. There is an understanding that first-time offenders may have the potential for reformation which weighed in favor of a more lenient sentence.

3. **Agreement to Close Business**:
