## Case Statement  

On the 12th of January 2023 at approximately 8:30 PM, C. King, along with an accomplice, forcibly entered the residence of J. Doe, located at 128 Maple Avenue, Eastwood. Initial investigations revealed that C. King was armed with a kitchen knife at the time of entry. Approximately thirty minutes into the unlawful entry, C. King fatally stabbed J. Doe multiple times in the chest. The brutality and premeditation of the act were evidenced by the nature and severity of the inflicted wounds, which subsequent autopsy confirmed led to the immediate demise of J. Doe.

Witness M. Wong, a neighbor, identified C. King entering the residence, a crucial piece of evidence that significantly corroborated the prosecution's case. The physical evidence, including the blood-stained knife bearing the fingerprints of C. King, was conclusive and irrefutable. Surveillance footage further substantiated the sequence of events showing C. King and his accomplice progressing towards the victim's residence on the night of the crime.

At around 9:05 PM, C. King was seen fleeing the scene in a blue Ford pickup truck, an action that was visually documented through testimony from R. Patel, a local shop owner, and supported by traffic camera footage on Bridge Street.

Approximately one hour after the incident, at about 10:00 PM, the defendant disposed of his blood-stained clothing and the weapon in a dumpster behind a grocery store located on Park Avenue. This act was meticulously captured by the grocery store’s surveillance camera.

In a comprehensive investigation, forensics analysis affirmed that the blood on the clothing and the knife matched the DNA of the victim, J. Doe. This direct and undeniable correspondence was instrumental in establishing the culpability of C. King beyond a reasonable doubt.

## Evidence Description  

### Written Evidence  

1. **Witness Statement from M. Wong:** M. Wong, who resides in close proximity to the victim’s home, provided a compelling account of having seen C. King forcibly entering the victim’s residence at around 8:30 PM on the 12th of January 2023. This eyewitness testimony forms the bedrock of the circumstantial evidence leading to the indictment.
  
### Physical Evidence  

1. **Blood-Stained Knife:** The kitchen knife recovered from the crime scene was a pivotal piece of evidence. Bearing the unmistakable fingerprints of C. King, it was critically instrumental in implicating the defendant in the fatal stabbing of J. Doe. Forensic analysis verified that the blood found on the knife corresponded to the DNA of the victim, J. Doe.

### Medical Evidence  

1. **Autopsy Report:** The autopsy conducted on J. Doe detailed multiple stab wounds to the chest, which were consistent with the knife recovered. The medical examiner concluded that these injuries were inflicted with significant force, clearly indicative of an intentional act to cause fatal harm.

### Surveillance Footage  

1. **ATM Surveillance Footage:** Footage from a nearby ATM captured at 8:15 PM on the 12th of January 2023, exhibited the defendant, C. King, and his accomplice, approaching the victim’s residence. This visual documentation underscored the premeditated nature of the act.
  
2. **Traffic Camera Footage on Bridge Street:** This footage surveilled at around 9:05 PM on the 12th of January 2023, captured the blue Ford pickup truck, later identified as belonging to the defendant's accomplice, speeding away from the vicinity of the crime scene. 

3. **Grocery Store Camera:** Surveillance from the grocery store located on Park Avenue incontrovertibly showed C. King discarding his blood-stained clothing and the weapon into a dumpster at around 10:00 PM on the night in question.

## Sentencing Considerations  

In deliberation, this court has taken into account the following considerations for sentencing:

- **Severity and Brutality of the Crime:** C. King executed a deliberate and violent act of homicide which led to the death of J. Doe. The ferocity and number of stab wounds inflicted are indicative of a determined intent to kill.

- **Premeditation:** The defendant, alongside his accomplice, was armed and had entered the residence with the clear intention of causing bodily harm, as evinced by their actions preceding the incident.

- **Lack of Previous Criminal Record:** While the gravity of C. King’s actions warranted severe punishment, this court acknowledged that the defendant had not been previously convicted of any criminal offenses. This lack of prior criminal history played a mitigating role in the court's final judgment.

## Judgment Result  

Upon thorough review and consideration of all presented evidence and arguments, this court finds the defendant, C. King, guilty of the crime of Intentional Homicide. Consequently, the court imposes the following sentence:

**Life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 25 years.**

This sentence takes into account the severity of the crime, the premeditated and brutal nature of the act, and recognizes the defendant’s otherwise clean criminal record.
