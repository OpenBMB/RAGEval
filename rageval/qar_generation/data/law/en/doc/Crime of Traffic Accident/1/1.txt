**Case Procedures:**

**1. Case Filing and Investigation**:

On March 15, 2023, the Lakewood, Pinehurst, Procuratorate received a report regarding a fatal traffic accident that occurred on March 14, 2023, involving the defendant, M. Bennett. An investigation team was promptly assembled to gather preliminary evidence, including witness statements and surveillance footage.

**2. Detention Measures Taken**:

Based on initial findings, on March 20, 2023, the investigation team determined that there was sufficient evidence to detain M. Bennett. This decision was made to ensure that further questioning could be conducted without interference and to prevent potential evidence tampering.

**3. Criminal Detention**:

On March 22, 2023, M. Bennett was formally placed under criminal detention by the Lakewood Police Department. This action was taken pending further investigation and the filing of formal charges. Bennett was informed of his rights and the charges aligned against him.

**4. Arrest**:

On March 25, 2023, based on additional evidence obtained during the detention period, the Lakewood, Pinehurst, Procuratorate issued an arrest warrant for M. Bennett. The formal charge was for causing a major traffic accident resulting in a fatality. Bennett was taken into custody without incident and was formally charged. 

**Case Statement:**

On the evening of March 14, 2023, at approximately 8:30 PM, the defendant, M. Bennett, was operating a Ford Transit Van under the influence of alcohol. Traveling at an excessive speed of 70 mph in a 40 mph zone on Pinehurst Avenue, Bennett collided with a pedestrian. The collision resulted in the immediate death of the pedestrian, later identified as one Richard Hargreaves.

The prosecution presented extensive evidence, including:

**Charge:**

Crime of Traffic Accident under Article No. 133 of our legal code. The defendant, M. Bennett, is accused of causing a traffic fatality due to reckless driving combined with intoxication, failing to render aid, and attempting to flee the scene of the crime.

**Evidence Description:**

The prosecution presented the following detailed evidence to support their charges:

**1. Witness Testimonies:**

Three bystanders present at the scene provided independent eyewitness accounts. Each confirmed that the defendant was speeding significantly and exhibited erratic driving behavior before colliding with the pedestrian. These accounts corroborate the severity and recklessness of Bennett’s actions on the night in question.

**2. Traffic Surveillance Footage:**

Footage obtained from nearby traffic surveillance cameras captured the collision in real-time. This footage was analyzed frame by frame to ascertain the speed of Bennett’s van and the events leading up to the crash, providing indisputable visual proof of his excessive speed and failure to adhere to traffic regulations.

**3. Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) Test:**

A blood alcohol test, conducted on Bennett shortly after his apprehension, revealed a BAC of 0.12%. This level is significantly over the legal limit, which played a crucial role in demonstrating Bennett’s impaired driving capabilities and thereby his criminal negligence.

**4. Police Accident Report:**

The official police accident report, detailed by the attending officers at the crash scene, described the physical evidence collected, including skid marks indicative of high-speed driving and the defendant’s vehicle's path of travel.

**5. Post-Collision Behavior:**

After the accident, the defendant attempted to flee the scene, as evidenced by surveillance from street cameras and the contents of the police chase report. Bennett was apprehended after a brief pursuit, further evidencing his attempt to evade responsibility.

**6. Physical Evidence:**

At the time of his capture, physical evidence, including an open bottle of whiskey found in the defendant’s vehicle, supported claims of his intoxicated state. Additionally, field sobriety tests administered on-site by the arresting officers confirmed Bennett's impaired reflexes and coordination.

**Sentencing Considerations:**

In determining the sentence, this court considered several aggravating factors:

1. **Severity of the Accident:**
   The accident resulted in the immediate death of an innocent pedestrian, which underscores the grave consequences of Bennett’s actions.
2. **Attempt to Flee the Scene:**
   By attempting to escape, Bennett showed a blatant disregard for the victim and the broader legal responsibilities that follow such incidents.
3. **Intoxication Level:**
   Operating a vehicle with a BAC of 0.12% demonstrates a severe lapse in judgment and a high degree of negligence.

No mitigating circumstances were presented. Bennett did not exhibit remorse, nor were there any factors to lessen the severity of the punishment warranted by his actions.

**Judgment Result:**

Based on the evidence presented and the severity of the offense, this court finds M. Bennett guilty of the Crime of Traffic Accident under Article No. 133 of our legal code.

The sentence is as follows:

M. Bennett is hereby sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of five years without the possibility of probation.

**Appeal Rights Explanation:**

The defendant has the right to appeal this judgment. If you wish to file an appeal, it must be submitted within 15 days from the date of receiving this written judgment. The appeal shall be submitted to this court and will then be forwarded to the Court of Appeals for further consideration.

If the defendant does not appeal within the prescribed timeframe, the judgment will be deemed final and binding.

This judgment is pronounced on June 30, 2023, and shall be executed in accordance with our legal provisions.
