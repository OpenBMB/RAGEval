### Case Procedures
The proceedings of this case began on the 15th of March, 2023, when the case was filed and an investigation was initiated. Subsequently, on the 20th of March, 2023, detention measures were enforced to ensure the presence of the defendant during the investigative process. On the 25th of March, 2023, G. Torres was placed under criminal detention. Formal arrest followed on the 30th of March, 2023.

### Case Statement
The events leading to this prosecution began at approximately 10:15 AM on the 10th of March, 2023, when the defendant, G. Torres, was operating a 2018 Toyota Camry with the license plate number ABC123. While driving along Elm Street approaching the intersection of Main Avenue, Torres failed to observe the traffic signal indicating a red light. Consequently, she proceeded through the intersection without stopping. During this time, pedestrian Mr. J. Smith was lawfully crossing the street at the designated crosswalk.

The collision between G. Torres’ vehicle and Mr. Smith was severe, resulting in life-threatening injuries to Mr. Smith, including multiple fractures and significant blood loss. Despite the conspicuousness and the severity of the incident, G. Torres chose not to stop and provide assistance, detailing events indicative of clear conscious avoidance of responsibility. Surveillance footage corroborates that she continued to drive away from the scene towards an undetermined location.

At approximately 10:20 AM, G. Torres hastened away from the accident site, failing in her legal obligation to render aid or await law enforcement’s arrival. This act of fleeing the scene evidenced an attempt to elude accountability for the occurring accident and its grave repercussions.

Not long after, at roughly 11:00 AM the same day, G. Torres executed further measures to obscure her complicity in the incident. She parked the damaged Toyota Camry in a remote and less frequented garage, subsequently making arrangements to have the car repaired, purposefully neglecting to report the accident to the police. Records from Jet Auto Repair where she scheduled the repair and a technician's testimony align to substantiate this claim. Surveillance footage from the garage further elucidates her actions.

### Charges
The charges levied against G. Torres comprise violation of traffic regulations resulting in severe bodily harm to a pedestrian, criminal negligence, fleeing the scene of an accident, and deliberate attempts to conceal involvement in the aforementioned crime. These infractions contravene the stipulations under Article No. 133.

### Evidence Description
1. **Traffic Camera Footage**:
   The traffic camera footage at the intersection of Elm Street and Main Avenue provides explicit evidence of the defendant ignoring the red light and continuing through the intersection, leading directly to the collision with Mr. J. Smith. This footage vividly captures the sequence of events, establishing a timeline consistent with the incident reported.

2. **Eyewitness Testimony from Ms. L. Johnson**:
   Ms. L. Johnson, a bystander at the scene, provided a detailed account of observing the defendant's vehicle running the red light and striking Mr. Smith. Her testimony highlighted the immediate aftermath, describing Torres' failure to stop and rendering the required aid.

3. **Medical Reports from Bayside General Hospital**:
   Medical documentation reflects the extent of injuries sustained by Mr. Smith, noting severe fractures, internal injuries, and considerable blood loss, specify the negated necessity for emergency medical intervention and subsequent long-term treatment for recovery.

4. **GPS Data from G. Torres' Vehicle**:
   Analysis of the vehicle’s GPS data demonstrates Torres’ movements post-incident, reaffirming her departure from the site without stopping. This spatial information corroborates her attempts to evade further scrutiny.

5. **Witness Testimony from Mr. K. Wu**:
   Mr. K. Wu, another witness, confirmed sighting the proceeding actions of Torres driving away in haste post-collision. Wu was able to provide descriptive details about the vehicle and its direction of travel.

6. **Repair Service Records from Jet Auto Repair**:
   Upon investigation, the records from Jet Auto Repair showcase G. Torres' repair booking and her communication regarding damages to the front end of her vehicle, notably the actions taken to mitigate the visual evidence of her involvement.

7. **Surveillance Footage from the Garage**:
   Footage obtained from the garage where Torres parked her vehicle elucidates the concealment efforts and further interactions pertinent to the attempted repair arrangements.

8. **Statements from Repair Shop Technician, Mr. R. Lee**:
   Mr. R. Lee provided valuable insights into his interaction with G. Torres, confirming her reluctance to disclose the actual circumstances of the damages and her subsequent booking for vehicular repairs.

### Sentencing Considerations
In determining the appropriate sentence for the crime of Traffic Accident under Article No. 133, this court has weighed the following factors:

1. **Severity of the Pedestrian’s Injuries**:
   The court acknowledges the extensive and grievous nature of Mr. Smith’s injuries, which necessitated immediate and ongoing medical treatment and fundamentally impacted his quality of life.

2. **Failure to Stop and Render Aid**:
   The defendant's failure to comply with the obligation to stop and assist the injured party demonstrates a blatant disregard for human life and legal responsibilities, meriting severe punitive measures.

3. **Attempt to Conceal Involvement**:
   The proactive steps taken by G. Torres to obfuscate her involvement – including parking the vehicle in a remote location and scheduling repairs without notifying authorities – illustrate a conscious endeavor to avert justice.

4. **Remorse Exhibited During Trial**:
   Despite the gravity of her actions, G. Torres exhibited signs of remorse during the trial proceedings. She expressed regret and acknowledged her negligence and its consequences.

5. **Absence of Prior Criminal Record**:
   The court has taken into account that G. Torres maintains no prior criminal history, which traditionally might suggest a likelihood of reform and absence of habitual criminal behavior.

### Judgment Result
Based on the evidence presented and the legal arguments made, this court finds G. Torres guilty of the Crime of Traffic Accident as per Article No. 133. Consequently, this court sentences G. Torres to four years of fixed-term imprisonment. 

### Appeal Rights Explanation
This court informs G. Torres of her right to appeal this judgment. In accordance with legal statutes, the defendant has the right to file an appeal within ten days from this date if she believes the judgment to be erroneous or unjust. The appeal must be comprehensively justified and submitted to the appropriate appellate court within the stipulated period. Failure to appeal within the provided timeframe shall render this judgment final and binding.

This concludes the formal judgment for the case involving G. Torres. All parties have been duly notified of their rights and obligations henceforth.
