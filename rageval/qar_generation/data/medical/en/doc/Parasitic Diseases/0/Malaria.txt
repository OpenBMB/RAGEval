Symptoms: The main symptoms of malaria are chills, high fever, sweating, headache, limb aches, and fatigue. After a certain incubation period, the symptoms recur. Severe cases can lead to complications such as anemia, hypoglycemia, acute renal failure, or acute pulmonary edema.
Differential Diagnosis: Malaria should be differentiated from various febrile diseases such as sepsis, typhoid, leptospirosis, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, schistosomiasis, biliary tract infections, and urinary tract infections. When it develops into cerebral malaria, it should be differentiated from Japanese encephalitis, moderate bacillary dysentery, sporadic viral encephalitis, etc.
