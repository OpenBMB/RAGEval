Specialist Examination:

Preliminary Diagnosis:
Peptic Ulcer

Diagnostic Basis:
Based on history of upper abdominal pain with a burning sensation, acid reflux, heartburn, and supportive findings from the upper GI endoscopy.

Differential Diagnosis:
Gastric cancer ruled out due to the absence of malignant features on endoscopy; chronic gastritis less likely given the presence of a defined peptic ulcer; gastric neurosis less likely due to the presence of organic findings; cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and gastrinoma ruled out based on clinical presentation and endoscopy results.
