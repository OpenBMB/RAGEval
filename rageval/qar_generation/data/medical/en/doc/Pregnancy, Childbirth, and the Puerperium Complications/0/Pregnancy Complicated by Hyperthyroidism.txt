Pregnancy complicated by hyperthyroidism

Diagnostic Basis
Based on history of hyperthyroidism, physical examination (goiter, tachycardia, exophthalmos), and laboratory tests (low TSH, elevated T4 and T3).

Differential Diagnosis
Simple goiter during pregnancy ruled out by high levels of thyroid hormones; subacute thyroiditis and Hashimoto's disease ruled out by clinical presentation and lab values.
