**Case Statement:**

This narrative details the unfolding of events that led to the tragic demise of James White, a 54-year-old patient who was admitted to Charleston General Hospital.

James White was admitted on the 5th of April, 2024, for management of severe chronic pain and complications arising from metastatic carcinoma. On the 7th of April, 2024, T. Collins, while on her night shift, attended to Mr. White. Due to an error in medication calculation, T. Collins administered a double dose of morphine—a potent opioid prescribed to manage extreme pain. The standard protocol entailed a precise dosage to mitigate potential overdose risks.

The breach in protocol first came to light when the hospital pharmacist Julia Reed generated an alert flagging an unusual morphine withdrawal from the hospital dispensary. Upon reviewing the medical records and cross-referencing video surveillance footage from the medication room, it was evident that T. Collins had administered a 20 mg dose instead of the prescribed 10 mg. Julia Reed provided a testimony corroborated by the pharmacological records, drawing an indisputable timeline of events that furthered the case against T. Collins.

In the subsequent days following this critical miscalculation, T. Collins made another significant error on the 10th of April, 2024. According to the hospital’s protocol, continuous monitoring of Mr. White’s vital signs was imperative due to his weakened state and the potent medication he had received. However, T. Collins neglected this requirement and failed to monitor Mr. White's vital parameters for an extended duration of 4 hours, significantly deviating from expected healthcare standards. Dr. Alan Turner’s testimony, alongside the monitoring logs, offered irrefutable evidence presenting the defendant’s gross negligence.

The culmination of this series of lapses occurred on the same day, when at approximately 5:30 PM, fellow nurse Jean Hall discovered Mr. White in a critical and deteriorating condition. Instead of instantaneously calling for the emergency response team, T. Collins hesitated and delayed the emergency call by a critical 15 minutes. The call logs and internal investigation report corroborated this delay, rendering the response significantly ineffective. By the time the emergency team was mobilized, Mr. White had succumbed to respiratory failure, a condition exacerbated by morphine overdose coupled with the absence of timely medical intervention.

**Charge:**

T. Collins stands charged under the statute defined in Article No. 133, accused of committing the crime of Negligent Homicide. The charges are predicated upon substantiated claims of medical negligence culminating in the unfortunate demise of James White.

---

**Evidence Description:**

The detailed and meticulous collation of evidence presented before the court includes the following:

1. **Medical Records:** The most formidable pieces of evidence constitute the hospital's medical records which depict a meticulous history of administered medications. These records, digitized and timestamped, unveil the dosage error whereby T. Collins administered a 20 mg dose of morphine, deviating from the prescribed 10 mg.

2. **Surveillance Footage:** The surveillance footage from the medication room corroborates the timeline as suggested by the pharmacist’s alert. It unmistakably captures T. Collins retrieving and administering the morphine dose, without adhering to the double verification system mandated by hospital policy.

3. **Witness Testimonies:** The various testimonies from hospital staff, particularly that of Julia Reed (pharmacist) and Dr. Alan Turner, construct a detailed narrative articulating the lapses in protocol and monitoring. Julia Reed’s intricate explanation about the pharmacological alert system and her subsequent visit to the nursing station adds credibility to the charge.

   - **Jean Hall:** In her testimony, Jean Hall (fellow nurse) delineated the discovery of Mr. White’s critical state and highlighted the defendant’s observable panic and delayed response in calling the emergency team.
   
   - **Dr. Alan Turner:** Provided expert testimony substantiating the medical necessity for constant monitoring of a patient under such high dosage of morphine, supporting the claim that T. Collins' actions were a deviation from accepted medical standards and protocols.

4. **Electronic Monitoring Logs:** The logs unequivocally exhibit a lapse in scheduled vital signs monitoring, reinforcing the claim that Mr. White’s deteriorating condition could have been preemptively addressed had proper attention been maintained.

5. **Call Log Records and Internal Report:** The call logs highlight a 15-minute undue delay in contacting the emergency response team. The internal investigation report substantiates this delay, indicating that this period was crucial and potentially decisive in the patient’s outcome.

**Sentencing Considerations:**

It is the responsibility of this court to weigh both mitigating and aggravating factors before determining a fair sentence.

**Mitigating Factors:**

1. **First-time Offender:** T. Collins has no prior criminal record, which is given substantial weight in the deliberation of sentencing. Her longstanding service without previous incidents is a mitigating element.
   
2. **Remorse and Cooperation:** Throughout the investigation and subsequent trial, T. Collins exhibited genuine remorse. She cooperated fully with the investigative authorities and the court, a behavior that reflects her recognition of the gravity of her lapse in judgment.

3. **Good Character:** Numerous character references from colleagues and former patients testify to T. Collins’ dedication, empathy, and previously exemplary conduct in her nursing role, reinforcing her positive contributions to the community over her career span.

**Aggravating Factors:**

1. **Direct Consequences:** The administration of a double morphine dose, failure to monitor the patient’s vitals, and the delay in emergency response exhibit a pattern of gross negligence. The result of these cumulative infringements directly contributed to the patient’s death, necessitating a custodial sentence.
   
2. **Professional Responsibility:** As a registered nurse, T. Collins held a fiduciary duty towards her patient’s well-being, a responsibility she neglected. The breach in this trust magnifies the severity of her actions, as they resulted in fatal consequences.

**Judgment Result:**

Having meticulously examined the evidence presented, and considering both the mitigating and aggravating factors, this court finds T. Collins guilty of the Crime of Negligent Homicide pursuant to Article No. 133.

**Sentence:**

The court has endeavored to balance the circumstances of the crime with the personal history and rehabilitative prospects of the defendant.
