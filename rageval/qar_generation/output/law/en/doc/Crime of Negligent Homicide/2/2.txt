### ***IV. Case Statement***

Based on the exhaustive investigation and evidence accumulation conducted by the Hartford Ashland Procuratorate, the events transpired as follows:

**Background and Context:**

The defendant, M. Cooper, held the designation of Construction Site Manager at the construction project located at 45, Elm Street, Ashland. The project entailed substantial responsibilities concerning site supervision, adherence to safety protocols, and ensuring the structural integrity of all temporary and permanent construction installations.

**Events and Incidents:**

1. **On the 8th day of February 2022:**

   The defendant, M. Cooper, exhibited a lack of due diligence and improper supervision concerning the erection and securing of scaffolding on the construction site. Multiple site inspection reports indicated pivotal irregularities and deficiencies in the stabilization of the scaffolding, posing substantial hazards to site operatives.

2. **On the 10th day of February 2022:**

   Despite receiving multiple warnings and notifications from the project engineer and site safety officer regarding the inherent instability and potential dangers posed by the scaffolding, the defendant neglected to undertake or implement any corrective measures. M. Cooper's disregard for these explicit warnings constituted gross negligence.

3. **On the 10th day of February 2022 (subsequent to neglect):**

    At approximately 2:45 PM, the compromised scaffolding structure collapsed, resulting in the catastrophic accident and immediate fatality of a construction worker named J. Harris. The collapse's devastating consequences were corroborated through security footage, corroborative witness testimonies, and forensic autopsy conclusions.

### ***V. Charge***

Consequently, the defendant, M. Cooper, was indicted and charged with the Crime of Negligent Homicide, as stipulated under Article No. 133, acknowledging the defendant's supervisory role and negligence as directly contributory to the fatal incident.

### ***VI. Evidence Description***

1. **Site Inspection Reports:**
    Comprehensive inspection reports spanning multiple dates elaborated on the structural inadequacies and non-compliance of the scaffolding setup, directly implicating the site management under M. Cooper's purview.

2. **Photographic Evidence:**
    Detailed photographs captured during routine checks and post-incident forensics substantiated the unstable condition and inadequate securing of the scaffolding structure at various stages of the project timeline.

3. **Testimony of Site Safety Officer:**
    The site’s safety officer provided detailed testimonies affirming the issuance of multiple safety warnings, the nature of communications with M. Cooper, and observations of the defendant's inaction concerning rectifying the identified hazards.

4. **Email Correspondences:**
    Secure communications between the project engineer and M. Cooper dated 10th February 2022 delineated explicit warnings and professional recommendations for immediate corrective actions, regrettably ignored by the defendant.

5. **Recorded Phone Calls:**
    Recorded telephonic conversations documented on 10th February 2022 served as critical evidence, reflecting the project engineer's desperate attempts to convey the urgency and severity of the scaffolding issue to M. Cooper.

6. **Witness Testimonies:**
    Direct testimonies from three construction workers offered a chronological narrative of preceding events, detailing the verbal warnings ignored by M. Cooper and the observable negligence in implementing required safety measures.

7. **Autopsy Report and Death Certificate:**
    The autopsy report confirmed the cause of J. Harris's death attributable to fatal injuries sustained during the scaffolding collapse. The death certificate authenticated the time and circumstances surrounding the untimely demise.

8. **Security Camera Footage:**
    Uninterrupted security camera footage further solidified the sequence of events, depicting the collapse's precise moment and the perilous conditions leading up to the tragic incident.

### ***VII. Sentencing Considerations***

This Court, upon thorough deliberation of the presented evidence and aggravating as well as mitigating factors, duly considers the following:

- **Aggravating Factor:**
    The defendant's position of responsibility and failure to act upon critical safety warnings magnifies the negligence, directly causing a significant loss of life.

- **Mitigating Factors:**
    However, it's notable that M. Cooper exhibited a cooperative demeanor throughout the investigation, possessed no prior criminal record, and demonstrated genuine remorse post-incident.

### ***VIII. Judgment Result***

In accordance with the prosecution's submission, comprehensive analysis of the evidence, and bearing in mind the prescribed legal provisions, this Court imposes the following judgment upon the defendant, M. Cooper:

For the charge of **Negligent Homicide** as per Article No. 133, the defendant is sentenced to:

    **Four years of fixed-term imprisonment**

The Court views this sentence as just and equitable, balancing the gravity of the offense with the circumstances surrounding the defendant's actions and personal history.

### ***IX. Appeal Rights Explanation***

This Court informs the defendant, M. Cooper, of the legal right to appeal the judgment and sentence within 30 days from the date of this judgment as per statutory provisions. The appeal may be lodged to a higher court for re-evaluation of the case facts, reconsideration of the legal aspects, or potential redressal of grievances arising from the judgment rendered herein.
