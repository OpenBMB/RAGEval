In the early evening of the 12th of December, 2022, from 18:00 to 18:20, the defendant forcibly entered ‘GreenMart,’ a local grocery store on Elm Street. Claiming the store sold expired goods, she accused the store manager, culminating in a heated argument.

Store surveillance captured the entire episode, providing clear visual evidence of the destructive acts committed by the defendant.
