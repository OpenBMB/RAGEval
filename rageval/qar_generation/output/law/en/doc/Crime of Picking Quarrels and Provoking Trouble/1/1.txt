**7. Sentencing Considerations:**

In determining the appropriate sentence for Y. Nelson, this court considered the frequency and seriousness of her actions, the resultant impact on public order, and the fact that she had previously been issued several warnings. Despite these warnings, the defendant continued her disruptive conduct unabated. The cumulative effect of her actions had a profound adverse impact on the community's peace and security.

The court also weighed the need for deterrence, both specific to the defendant and general to the public, to prevent similar future occurrences. The continued pattern of aggressive and provocative behavior indicated a lack of remorse and a disregard for community norms and legal requirements.

**8. Judgment Result:**

This court finds the defendant, Y. Nelson, guilty of the Crime of Picking Quarrels and Provoking Trouble under Article No. 293 of the Criminal Code. Accordingly, Y. Nelson is sentenced to three years of fixed-term imprisonment.

Consideration for probation was evaluated. However, given the recurring nature and escalation of the defendant's conduct despite previous warnings, suspension of the sentence or probation was deemed unsuitable for this case.

The defendant has the right to appeal this judgment. In accordance with the statutory provisions, if the defendant chooses to do so, the appeal must be filed within ten (10) days from the date of serving this judgment.
