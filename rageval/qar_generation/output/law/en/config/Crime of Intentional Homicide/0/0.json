Mendoza  \n**Court Clerk:** Z. Davis  \n\n### Prosecutor Information  \n**Procuratorate:** Trenton, Eastwood Procuratorate  \n\n### Defendant Information  \n**Name:** C. King  \n**Gender:** Male  \n**Date of Birth:** 23rd October 1974  \n**Residence:** 64 Arlington Street, Eastwood  \n**Ethnicity:** Caucasian  \n**Occupation:** Construction Worker  \n\n### Defense Lawyer Information  \n**Name:** O. Rodriguez  \n**Law Firm:** Rodriguez & Associates  \n\n---\n\n## Case Procedures  \n\nThe procedural history of this case is as follows:\n\n### Case Filing and Investigation  \nOn the 15th of January 2023, the Trenton, Eastwood Procuratorate initiated an investigation into the crime of intentional homicide committed by the defendant, C. King, on the 12th of January 2023.\n\n### Detention Measures Taken  \nOn the 20th of January 2023, appropriate detention measures were taken to ensure the apprehension of the defendant.\n\n### Criminal Detention  \nOn the 22nd of January 2023, C. King was placed under criminal detention warranting further inquiry and scrutiny into the fatal incident of the 12th of January 2023.\n\n### Arrest  \nOn the 25th of January 2023, a formal order of arrest was executed against the defendant, C. King, upon findings supported by substantial evidence.\n\n---\n\n## Case Statement  \n\nOn the 12th of January 2023 at approximately 8:30 PM, C. King, along with an accomplice, forcibly entered the residence of J. Doe, located at 128 Maple Avenue, Eastwood. Initial investigations revealed that C. King was armed with a kitchen knife at the time of entry. Approximately thirty minutes into the unlawful entry, C. King fatally stabbed J. Doe multiple times in the chest. The brutality and premeditation of the act were evidenced by the nature and severity of the inflicted wounds, which subsequent autopsy confirmed led to the immediate demise of J. Doe.\n\nWitness M. Wong, a neighbor, identified C. King entering the residence, a crucial piece of evidence that significantly corroborated the prosecution's case. The physical evidence, including the blood-stained knife bearing the fingerprints of C. King, was conclusive and irrefutable. Surveillance footage further substantiated the sequence of events showing C. King and his accomplice progressing towards the victim's residence on the night of the crime.\n\nAt around 9:05 PM, C. King was seen fleeing the scene in a blue Ford pickup truck, an action that was visually documented through testimony from R. Patel, a local shop owner, and supported by traffic camera footage on Bridge Street.\n\nApproximately one hour after the incident, at about 10:00 PM, the defendant disposed of his blood-stained clothing and the weapon in a dumpster behind a grocery store located on Park Avenue. This act was meticulously captured by the grocery store’s surveillance camera.\n\nIn a comprehensive investigation, forensics analysis affirmed that the blood on the clothing and the knife matched the DNA of the victim, J. Doe. This direct and undeniable correspondence was instrumental in establishing the culpability of C. King beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n---\n\n## Charges  \n\nThe procuratorate has charged the defendant, C. King, with the following offense:  \n- **Intentional Homicide** as per Article 232.\n\n---\n\n## Evidence Description  \n\n### Written Evidence  \n\n1. **Witness Statement from M. Wong:** M. Wong, who resides in close proximity to the victim’s home, provided a compelling account of having seen C. King forcibly entering the victim’s residence at around 8:30 PM on the 12th of January 2023. This eyewitness testimony forms the bedrock of the circumstantial evidence leading to the indictment.\n  \n### Physical Evidence  \n\n1. **Blood-Stained Knife:** The kitchen knife recovered from the crime scene was a pivotal piece of evidence. Bearing the unmistakable fingerprints of C. King, it was critically instrumental in implicating the defendant in the fatal stabbing of J. Doe. Forensic analysis verified that the blood found on the knife corresponded to the DNA of the victim, J. Doe.\n\n### Medical Evidence  \n\n1. **Autopsy Report:** The autopsy conducted on J. Doe detailed multiple stab wounds to the chest, which were consistent with the knife recovered. The medical examiner concluded that these injuries were inflicted with significant force, clearly indicative of an intentional act to cause fatal harm.\n\n### Surveillance Footage  \n\n1. **ATM Surveillance Footage:** Footage from a nearby ATM captured at 8:15 PM on the 12th of January 2023, exhibited the defendant, C. King, and his accomplice, approaching the victim’s residence. This visual documentation underscored the premeditated nature of the act.\n  \n2. **Traffic Camera Footage on Bridge Street:** This footage surveilled at around 9:05 PM on the 12th of January 2023, captured the blue Ford pickup truck, later identified as belonging to the defendant's accomplice, speeding away from the vicinity of the crime scene. \n\n3. **Grocery Store Camera:** Surveillance from the grocery store located on Park Avenue incontrovertibly showed C. King discarding his blood-stained clothing and the weapon into a dumpster at around 10:00 PM on the night in question.\n\n---\n\n## Sentencing Considerations  \n\nIn deliberation, this court has taken into account the following considerations for sentencing:\n\n- **Severity and Brutality of the Crime:** C. King executed a deliberate and violent act of homicide which led to the death of J. Doe. The ferocity and number of stab wounds inflicted are indicative of a determined intent to kill.\n\n- **Premeditation:** The defendant, alongside his accomplice, was armed and had entered the residence with the clear intention of causing bodily harm, as evinced by their actions preceding the incident.\n\n- **Lack of Previous Criminal Record:** While the gravity of C. King’s actions warranted severe punishment, this court acknowledged that the defendant had not been previously convicted of any criminal offenses. This lack of prior criminal history played a mitigating role in the court's final judgment.\n\n---\n\n## Judgment Result  \n\nUpon thorough review and consideration of all presented evidence and arguments, this court finds the defendant, C. King, guilty of the crime of Intentional Homicide. Consequently, the court imposes the following sentence:\n\n**Life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 25 years.**\n\nThis sentence takes into account the severity of the crime, the premeditated and brutal nature of the act, and recognizes the defendant’s otherwise clean criminal record.\n\n---\n\n## Appeal Rights Explanation\n\nAs per judicial process, the defendant is hereby informed of their right to appeal. C. King may file a notice of appeal within thirty (30) days from the date of this judgment. The procedural guidelines and requirements for filing an appeal must be strictly adhered to, failing which the right to appeal may be forfeited.\n\n---\n\nThis courtroom adjourns with the clear and unambiguous resolution of the case number 2023-01234, echoing the principles of justice and the rule of law.\n\n**Signed:**  \nP. Reyes, Presiding Judge  \nN. Mendoza, Associate Judge  \nZ. Davis, Court Clerk  \nTrenton, Eastwood Court  \nDated: 5th March 2023  \n\nReference Article is below：\nArticle 232\nThose who commit intentional homicide shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or fixed-term imprisonment of more than ten years; if the circumstances are relatively minor, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of more than three years but not more than ten years.",
