Alvarez  \nCourt Clerk: B. Mitchell  \n\n**Prosecutor:**\n\nLakewood, Pinehurst, Procuratorate\n\n**Defendant and Defense Lawyer Information:**\n\n**Defendant**:  \nName: M. Bennett  \nGender: Male  \nBirthdate: November 26, 2000  \nResidence: 81, Yarmouth Street, Pinehurst  \nEthnicity: Caucasian  \nOccupation: Delivery Driver  \n\n**Defense Lawyer**:  \nName: R. Thomas  \nLaw Firm: Thomas & Associates Law Firm  \n\n**Case Procedures:**\n\n**1. Case Filing and Investigation**:\n\nOn March 15, 2023, the Lakewood, Pinehurst, Procuratorate received a report regarding a fatal traffic accident that occurred on March 14, 2023, involving the defendant, M. Bennett. An investigation team was promptly assembled to gather preliminary evidence, including witness statements and surveillance footage.\n\n**2. Detention Measures Taken**:\n\nBased on initial findings, on March 20, 2023, the investigation team determined that there was sufficient evidence to detain M. Bennett. This decision was made to ensure that further questioning could be conducted without interference and to prevent potential evidence tampering.\n\n**3. Criminal Detention**:\n\nOn March 22, 2023, M. Bennett was formally placed under criminal detention by the Lakewood Police Department. This action was taken pending further investigation and the filing of formal charges. Bennett was informed of his rights and the charges aligned against him.\n\n**4. Arrest**:\n\nOn March 25, 2023, based on additional evidence obtained during the detention period, the Lakewood, Pinehurst, Procuratorate issued an arrest warrant for M. Bennett. The formal charge was for causing a major traffic accident resulting in a fatality. Bennett was taken into custody without incident and was formally charged. \n\n**Case Statement:**\n\nOn the evening of March 14, 2023, at approximately 8:30 PM, the defendant, M. Bennett, was operating a Ford Transit Van under the influence of alcohol. Traveling at an excessive speed of 70 mph in a 40 mph zone on Pinehurst Avenue, Bennett collided with a pedestrian. The collision resulted in the immediate death of the pedestrian, later identified as one Richard Hargreaves.\n\nThe prosecution presented extensive evidence, including:\n\n**Charge:**\n\nCrime of Traffic Accident under Article No. 133 of our legal code. The defendant, M. Bennett, is accused of causing a traffic fatality due to reckless driving combined with intoxication, failing to render aid, and attempting to flee the scene of the crime.\n\n**Evidence Description:**\n\nThe prosecution presented the following detailed evidence to support their charges:\n\n**1. Witness Testimonies:**\n\nThree bystanders present at the scene provided independent eyewitness accounts. Each confirmed that the defendant was speeding significantly and exhibited erratic driving behavior before colliding with the pedestrian. These accounts corroborate the severity and recklessness of Bennett’s actions on the night in question.\n\n**2. Traffic Surveillance Footage:**\n\nFootage obtained from nearby traffic surveillance cameras captured the collision in real-time. This footage was analyzed frame by frame to ascertain the speed of Bennett’s van and the events leading up to the crash, providing indisputable visual proof of his excessive speed and failure to adhere to traffic regulations.\n\n**3. Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) Test:**\n\nA blood alcohol test, conducted on Bennett shortly after his apprehension, revealed a BAC of 0.12%. This level is significantly over the legal limit, which played a crucial role in demonstrating Bennett’s impaired driving capabilities and thereby his criminal negligence.\n\n**4. Police Accident Report:**\n\nThe official police accident report, detailed by the attending officers at the crash scene, described the physical evidence collected, including skid marks indicative of high-speed driving and the defendant’s vehicle's path of travel.\n\n**5. Post-Collision Behavior:**\n\nAfter the accident, the defendant attempted to flee the scene, as evidenced by surveillance from street cameras and the contents of the police chase report. Bennett was apprehended after a brief pursuit, further evidencing his attempt to evade responsibility.\n\n**6. Physical Evidence:**\n\nAt the time of his capture, physical evidence, including an open bottle of whiskey found in the defendant’s vehicle, supported claims of his intoxicated state. Additionally, field sobriety tests administered on-site by the arresting officers confirmed Bennett's impaired reflexes and coordination.\n\n**Sentencing Considerations:**\n\nIn determining the sentence, this court considered several aggravating factors:\n\n1. **Severity of the Accident:**\n   The accident resulted in the immediate death of an innocent pedestrian, which underscores the grave consequences of Bennett’s actions.\n2. **Attempt to Flee the Scene:**\n   By attempting to escape, Bennett showed a blatant disregard for the victim and the broader legal responsibilities that follow such incidents.\n3. **Intoxication Level:**\n   Operating a vehicle with a BAC of 0.12% demonstrates a severe lapse in judgment and a high degree of negligence.\n\nNo mitigating circumstances were presented. Bennett did not exhibit remorse, nor were there any factors to lessen the severity of the punishment warranted by his actions.\n\n**Judgment Result:**\n\nBased on the evidence presented and the severity of the offense, this court finds M. Bennett guilty of the Crime of Traffic Accident under Article No. 133 of our legal code.\n\nThe sentence is as follows:\n\nM. Bennett is hereby sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of five years without the possibility of probation.\n\n**Appeal Rights Explanation:**\n\nThe defendant has the right to appeal this judgment. If you wish to file an appeal, it must be submitted within 15 days from the date of receiving this written judgment. The appeal shall be submitted to this court and will then be forwarded to the Court of Appeals for further consideration.\n\nIf the defendant does not appeal within the prescribed timeframe, the judgment will be deemed final and binding.\n\nThis judgment is pronounced on June 30, 2023, and shall be executed in accordance with our legal provisions.\n\n---\n\n**[Court Seal]**\n\nChief Judge: F. Lopez  \nJudge: A. Alvarez  \nCourt Clerk: B. Mitchell  \nDate: June 30, 2023\n\nReference Article is below：\nArticle 133\nViolating traffic and transportation management regulations, resulting in a major accident, causing serious injury, death, or significant property damage, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention; if they escape after a traffic accident or have other particularly egregious circumstances, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of more than three years but not more than seven years; if the escape causes death, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of more than seven years.",
