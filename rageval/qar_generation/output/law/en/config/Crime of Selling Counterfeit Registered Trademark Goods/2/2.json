Rodriguez\n\nProcuratorate: Trenton, Vandalia, Procuratorate\n\n## Defendant and Defense Lawyer Information\n\nDefendant: G. Torres  \nGender: Female  \nBirthdate: 10th August 1983  \nResidence: 32, Danbury Street, Vandalia  \nEthnicity: Hispanic  \nOccupation: Owner of a Retail Store\n\nDefense Lawyer: W. Ortiz  \nLaw Firm: Ortiz & Associates\n\n## Case Procedures\n\n### Case Filing and Investigation\n\nOn the 15th of January 2023, BrandSafe Inc. filed a complaint with the Trenton, Vandalia, Procuratorate, asserting that G. Torres, the owner of a local retail store, was engaging in the sale of counterfeit goods. The complaint triggered a prompt investigation, focusing on possible violations under Trademark Law for selling counterfeit registered trademark goods.\n\n### Detention Measures Taken\n\nDuring a raid on the 20th of January 2023, conducted by law enforcement officers at the retail premises owned by the defendant, significant quantities of counterfeit goods were discovered. These included various handbags mimicking known brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Chanel. Due to the large scale of the counterfeit items and the undeniable evidence of the infringing goods, initial detention measures were taken against the defendant, G. Torres.\n\n### Criminal Detention\n\nSubsequent to initial questioning and assessing the severity of the offense, G. Torres was placed into criminal detention on the 21st of January 2023 at the Vandalia Detention Center. Several crucial documents were seized and inventoried, including detailed inventory lists and transaction receipts, providing further proof of the illicit trade activities.\n\n### Arrest\n\nUpon gathering substantial evidence affirming the defendant's engagement in the sale of counterfeit goods, the Trenton, Vandalia, Procuratorate approved G. Torres's formal arrest on the 25th of January 2023. This decision was based on probable guilt and the need to prevent further illicit activities.\n\n## Case Statement\n\nThis court heard the case against G. Torres for the crime of selling counterfeit registered trademark goods between November 2022 and January 2023. The complaint and subsequent investigation revealed that within this period, G. Torres continued the sale of counterfeit items, including handbags branded falsely under names such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Chanel. These items were sold at her retail store where she misrepresented counterfeit goods as genuine, deceiving buyers and damaging the rightful owners' brand reputations.\n\n### Specific Incidents\n1. **November 2022 to January 2023**:\n   Throughout this stretch, G. Torres sold counterfeit handbags, attracting unsuspecting customers by presenting them as genuine high-end products. Inventory ledgers, receipts, and testimonies from undercover buyers spearheaded the evidence.\n\n2. **1st December 2022**:\n   In a significant promotional event labeled 'Best Deal Sale', the defendant explicitly advertised counterfeit goods as authentic items at heavy discounts. Advertising flyers and social media announcements tied to the store's promotions were key evidence used in court.\n\n3. **15th January 2023**:\n   On this date, an undercover officer posing as a regular customer purchased several counterfeit items from G. Torres's store. This interaction, recorded and documented through video evidence, significantly bolstered the prosecution's case.\n\n4. **Various Dates from November 2022 to January 2023**:\n   G. Torres deliberately continued replenishing her counterfeit stock through known unverified suppliers, despite understanding the illegal nature of these goods. Supplier communications, shipping records, and expert analyses confirmed that these items were counterfeit.\n\n## Charge\n\nG. Torres was charged under Article No. 214 for the Crime of Selling Counterfeit Registered Trademark Goods. The evidence substantiated that she knowingly engaged in the distribution of counterfeit luxury items, misleading consumers and infringing on the trademark rights of the authentic brands.\n\n## Evidence Description\n\n### Confiscated Goods and Inventory Lists\n\nDuring the raid, authorities confiscated a significant number of counterfeit handbags. Detailed inventory lists discovered at the scene indicated meticulous record-keeping, showcasing the extent of the counterfeit sales and the different brands mimicked.\n\n### Transaction Receipts\n\nNumerous transaction receipts found within the store premises verified the high volume of the counterfeit items sold. These receipts, alongside customer testimonials obtained from undercover operations, were crucial in outlining the illegal activities.\n\n### Undercover Purchases and Testimonies\n\nUndercover operations played a pivotal role in solidifying the case. On various occasions, undercover officers managed to make purchases of counterfeit goods which were later introduced as court exhibits. Their witness testimonies highlighted the defendant's conscious racket operation and deception towards customers.\n\n### Advertising Evidence\n\nPromotional materials used during the 'Best Deal Sale'—flyers and social media posts—explicitly claimed authenticity of brand products sold at marked-down prices. These materials were retrieved and submitted as evidence, displaying obvious attempts to mislead the public intentionally.\n\n### Supplier Records and Communications\n\nDocuments recovered from the store contained communications between G. Torres and her suppliers, detailing orders for counterfeit goods and subsequent shipments. These records, including emails and shipment logs, evidenced her awareness and intent to distribute these illicit items.\n\n### Expert Analysis\n\nExperts in trademark identification and counterfeit analysis were called to testify. They presented findings confirming the counterfeit nature of the goods, reviewing material inconsistencies and design flaws that deviate from authentic brand standards.\n\n## Sentencing Considerations\n\nIn determining the sentence for G. Torres, this court considered several crucial factors. These included:\n\n1. **Cooperation with Investigation**:\n   During the investigation, G. Torres exhibited a cooperative demeanor, providing access to records and assisting law enforcement in understanding the scope of her activities.\n\n2. **First-time Offense**:\n   It was duly noted that this incident represented G. Torres's first offense. There is an understanding that first-time offenders may have the potential for reformation which weighed in favor of a more lenient sentence.\n\n3. **Agreement to Close Business**:\n   G. Torres agreed to permanently shut down her retail store, thus demonstrating her willingness to cease the illegal activities and adhere to legal expectations.\n\n## Judgment Result\n\n**Crime**: Crime of Selling Counterfeit Registered Trademark Goods  \n**Sentence**: Three years of fixed-term imprisonment, suspended for five years, and a fine of $30,000.\n\nThe sentence represents a balanced approach, recognizing the severity of the crime while acknowledging the defendant's cooperation, lack of prior offenses, and proactive steps to prevent future occurrences.\n\n## Appeal Rights Explanation\n\nIn accordance with the law, G. Torres has the right to appeal this judgment. Should she disagree with the verdict or sentence, she may file an appeal to the appellate court within ten days from the date of receiving the judgment document. The appeal should detail the grounds on which she believes the judgment is flawed and present any mitigating evidence or arguments for reconsideration.\n\nThis court remains committed to ensuring fair legal proceedings and protecting trademark rights against counterfeit goods, thereby upholding the integrity of registered trademarks and safeguarding consumers from fraudulent practices.\n\n**Judgment Issued on 20th March 2023**  \nChief Judge Q. Martin  \nJudge V. Smith  \nClerk R. Rodriguez\n\nReference Article is below：\nArticle 214\nSelling goods that are known to be counterfeit registered trademarks, if the illegal gains are relatively large or there are other serious circumstances, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, and shall also be fined or solely fined; if the illegal gains are huge or there are other particularly serious circumstances, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of more than three years but not more than ten years, and shall also be fined.",
