Taylor**\n\n**DEFENDANT AND DEFENSE LAWYER INFORMATION**\n\nDefendant: Z. Torres\n\n- Gender: Male\n- Birthdate: 8th March 1983\n- Residence: 18, Elmwood Street, Quarryville\n- Ethnicity: Hispanic\n- Occupation: Owner of retail electronics store\n\nDefense Lawyer: N. Harris\n\n- Law Firm: Quarryville Law Associates\n\n**CASE PROCEDURES**\n\n**Case Filing and Investigation**\n\nOn the 1st of January, 2023, the Sterling Quarryville Procuratorate received an anonymous tip regarding the sale of counterfeit branded electronics goods at the retail store owned by Z. Torres. The information allegedly indicated that Torres was selling counterfeit products labeled as genuine high-end brands such as 'Apple' and 'Samsung.' Acting on this intelligence, an investigation was officially launched to ascertain the credibility of the allegations and the scope of the illegal activities.\n\n**Detention Measures Taken**\n\nOn the 15th of January, 2023, initial site inspections were conducted by authorities at Torres's retail store. These inspections confirmed the presence of suspected counterfeit goods on the premises. As a result, Z. Torres was placed under immediate detention to prevent the destruction of evidence or further illegal activities during the continuing investigation.\n\n**Criminal Detention**\n\nOn the 17th of January, 2023, following substantial preliminary evidence indicating his involvement in the crime, Z. Torres was officially placed under criminal detention by the Sterling Quarryville authorities.\n\n**Arrest**\n\nOn the 25th of January, 2023, after gathering more substantial evidence on the illicit activities, a formal arrest was made. Z. Torres was subsequently charged with the crime of selling counterfeit registered trademark goods, pursuant to Article No. 214.\n\n**CASE STATEMENT**\n\nThe defendant, Z. Torres, has been implicated in the serious crime of selling counterfeit registered trademark goods, betraying the trust of his consumers and infringing on intellectual property laws. The following is a detailed account of the defendant’s illicit activities, extending over several months, as compiled through meticulous investigation.\n\n**Criminal Facts**\n\n**August 2022 - December 2022**\n\nDuring this period, Z. Torres engaged in the purchase and sale of counterfeit electronics from an unverified supplier. These counterfeit electronics, including smartphones and accessories misrepresented as genuine 'Apple' and 'Samsung' products, were prominently displayed and sold at his store. Evidence collected includes confiscated counterfeit items, sales invoices, surveillance footage exhibiting transactions, and statements from five customers who unknowingly purchased counterfeit goods. These customers reported discrepancies that led to the revelation of the counterfeit nature of the purchased items.\n\n**November 2022**\n\nIn November 2022, a significant consignment of counterfeit 'Apple' products was received by Torres and subsequently put up for sale at prices similar to those of authentic products. Items in this consignment included iPhones, AirPods, and chargers. Evidence supporting this activity consists of delivery receipts, warehouse inventory logs showing stock levels before and after the consignment's arrival, payment transaction records, and multiple customer complaints questioning the authenticity of the products due to malfunctions and substandard performance.\n\n**October 2022**\n\nIn October 2022, Torres launched an online advertisement campaign falsely promoting the sale of high-quality branded electronics at reduced prices. This campaign resulted in a considerable increase in sales of counterfeit items. The digital trail includes copies of online advertisements, financial records of the increased online sales corresponding with the campaign period, and email exchanges between Torres and buyers regarding issues arising from the counterfeit products' inadequacies and defects.\n\n**CHARGE**\n\nThe defendant, Z. Torres, is hereby charged with the crime of selling counterfeit registered trademark goods, a severe violation that has economic, ethical, and legal implications. The sale of counterfeit goods under registered trademarks deliberately deceives consumers, is an intellectual property infringement, and undermines the reputation and economic interests of legitimate businesses.\n\n**EVIDENCE DESCRIPTION**\n\nThroughout the investigation and trial, multiple forms of evidence were brought forward to substantiate the allegations against the defendant, Z. Torres. This evidence is crucial to demonstrating the extent and depth of his involvement in the crime of selling counterfeit registered trademark goods.\n\n**Confiscated Counterfeit Items**\n\nDuring the initial inspections and subsequent searches of Torres's retail store and storage facilities, numerous counterfeit electronics branded as 'Apple' and 'Samsung' were confiscated. These items included smartphones, accessories like chargers and headphones, which were later confirmed as counterfeits by experts.\n\n**Sales Invoices and Financial Records**\n\nSales invoices and comprehensive financial records were examined meticulously, revealing the volume of counterfeit goods sold and the significant profits generated from these illicit sales. These records include documented transactions between Torres and his supplier and customers, indicating the flow of counterfeit items through his retail system.\n\n**Surveillance Footage**\n\nSurveillance footage from Torres’s store provided visual confirmation of the transactions involving counterfeit goods. This footage showed interactions between store employees and customers, where counterfeit items were presented and sold as genuine.\n\n**Customer Statements**\n\nStatements from five customers who purchased counterfeit goods were crucial in establishing the fraudulent nature of Torres's operations. These customers detailed their experiences, noting issues with product performance and revelations about the items' counterfeit nature upon closer inspection or after encountering malfunctions.\n\n**Delivery Receipts and Inventory Logs**\n\nDelivery receipts and warehouse inventory logs highlighted the arrival and distribution of significant consignments of counterfeit goods. These documents tracked the receipt of goods labeled as 'Apple' products, showing stock levels before and after the deliveries.\n\n**Customer Complaints**\n\nNumerous customer complaints regarding product authenticity and performance issues were documented. These complaints surfaced after customers experienced malfunctions with their purchases or upon realizing discrepancies that suggested the items were not legitimate branded products.\n\n**Digital Evidence**\n\nDigital evidence, including copies of online advertisements, financial records of the increased sales during the campaign period, and email exchanges with buyers, illustrated Torres’s extensive efforts to market and sell counterfeit goods through deceptive online campaigns.\n\n**SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS**\n\nIn determining the appropriate sentence for the defendant, Z. Torres, this court took into consideration several aggravating and mitigating factors:\n\n**Aggravating Factors:**\n\n1. **Substantial Illegal Gains**: The illegal activities resulted in significant financial profits for Torres, derived from the sale of counterfeit goods.\n2. **Extensive Distribution**: The counterfeit goods were distributed widely, impacting numerous consumers and potentially reaching various regions beyond Quarryville.\n3. **Deceptive Practices**: The intentional misrepresentation of counterfeit goods as genuine branded products demonstrates a deliberate attempt to defraud consumers and tarnishes the brands' integrity.\n\n**Mitigating Factors:**\n\n1. **First-Time Offender**: Torres has no prior criminal record, indicating a possible lapse in judgment rather than a habitual pattern of illegal behavior.\n2. **Cooperation with Authorities**: During certain phases of the investigation, Torres exhibited cooperation by providing information about his supplier and the logistics of his operations.\n\n**JUDGMENT RESULT**\n\nAfter considering the evidence and weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, this court rules as follows:\n\nDefendant: Z. Torres\nCrime: Selling Counterfeit Registered Trademark Goods\n\n**Sentence:**\n\n- Five years of fixed-term imprisonment\n- A fine of $100,000\n\n**Probation:**\n\nApplicable for five years, contingent on adherence to the terms and conditions set forth by the court.\n\n**APPEAL RIGHTS EXPLANATION**\n\nThe defendant, Z. Torres, is hereby informed of his right to appeal:\n\nPursuant to the applicable procedural laws, the defendant has the right to appeal this judgment. The appeal must be filed in writing to this court or directly to a higher court within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt of the written judgment. The defendant also has the right to legal representation during the appeal process to assist in presenting the grounds of the appeal and any new evidence that may be pertinent.\n\nShould the defendant choose to exercise the right to appeal, the execution of the sentence may be suspended pending the outcome of the appellate review, within the parameters allowed by the law.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis concludes the detailed judgment on the criminal case against Z. Torres for the crime of selling counterfeit registered trademark goods. The court reiterates the importance of maintaining the integrity of registered trademarks and protecting consumers from fraudulent practices. The sentence imposed reflects the seriousness of the offense and serves as a warning to others engaged in similar illegal activities. \n\nThis document, surely, embodies the thorough consideration and deliberation of the court in delivering justice while upholding the principles of the law.\n\n**Sincerely,**\n\n**H. Nguyen, Chief Judge**\n\n**U. Sanders, Judge**\n\n**Z. Taylor, Clerk**\n\n**Sterling Quarryville Court**\n\n**Dated: 15th March, 2023**\n\nReference Article is below：\nArticle 214\nSelling goods that are known to be counterfeit registered trademarks, if the illegal gains are relatively large or there are other serious circumstances, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, and shall also be fined or solely fined; if the illegal gains are huge or there are other particularly serious circumstances, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of more than three years but not more than ten years, and shall also be fined.",
