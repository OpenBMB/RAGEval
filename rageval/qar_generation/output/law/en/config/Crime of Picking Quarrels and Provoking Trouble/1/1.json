Detailed assessments of the collected evidence further implicated the defendant.\n\n*Criminal Detention:*  \nOn February 22, 2023, the Quailwood Police Department placed Y. Nelson under formal criminal detention following additional evidence collection and verification.\n\n*Arrest:*  \nOn March 15, 2023, the Glenwood, Quailwood Procuratorate issued an arrest warrant for Y. Nelson upon finding sufficient evidence to substantiate the charges.\n\n**4. Case Statement:**\n\nThe case revolves around a series of disruptive and aggressive behaviors exhibited by Y. Nelson between January 15, 2023, and March 12, 2023. Investigations revealed that her actions incited public disturbances, financial losses to vendors, and significant distress to community members.\n\nDuring the period from January 15, 2023, to February 5, 2023, Y. Nelson engaged in numerous provocations and quarrels in public places such as the central market and cafes in downtown Quailwood. Witness testimonies and surveillance footage confirmed her involvement in these disruptions.\n\nSubsequently, between February 10, 2023, and February 20, 2023, Y. Nelson forcibly took merchandise from market kiosks, refusing to pay and causing a combined estimated loss of approximately $800 for the vendors. Confiscated merchandise recovered from her residence substantiated these claims.\n\nOn March 12, 2023, Y. Nelson caused further disruption by obstructing traffic and shouting obscenities near a school zone, terrifying parents and students. This incident was corroborated by eyewitness accounts and school security footage.\n\n**5. Charge:**\n\nThe defendant, Y. Nelson, is charged with the Crime of Picking Quarrels and Provoking Trouble as specified under Article No. 293 of the Criminal Code.\n\n**6. Evidence Description:**\n\n*Incident from January 15, 2023, to February 5, 2023:*\n\n*Witness Testimony:*\nNumerous cafe owners and market vendors testified that Y. Nelson frequently insulted customers and instigated public disputes. Through her aggressive language and actions, she caused severe disruptions, affecting their businesses negatively.\n\n*Surveillance Footage:*\nSecurity cameras in the central market and various cafes captured Y. Nelson engaging in disputes, verbally harassing bystanders, and creating a hostile environment. The footage showed multiple instances where she actively initiated confrontations.\n\n*Police Reports:*\nDetailed reports from officers verified continuous disruptions caused by Y. Nelson. Officers documented various responses to complaints involving the defendant’s aggressive behavior in public spaces.\n\n*Incident from February 10, 2023, to February 20, 2023:*\n\n*Written Statements:*\nAffected vendors provided statements detailing their encounters with Y. Nelson, highlighting the financial losses incurred. They estimated the total worth of forcibly taken merchandise to be approximately $800.\n\n*Physical Evidence:*\nUnpaid merchandise was recovered from Y. Nelson's residence, further proving her involvement in the thefts. An inventory of items matched reports provided by the vendors.\n\n*Incident on March 12, 2023:*\n\n*Eyewitness Accounts:*\nSeveral parents and school staff submitted written accounts describing the incident. They depicted a scene of chaos and fear caused by Y. Nelson’s obstructions and obscene outbursts, which occurred during school dismissal, thus endangering students.\n\n*School Security Footage:*\nCCTV footage from the school's security cameras captured Y. Nelson obstructing traffic and screaming offensive language in the vicinity of the school zone. The recordings confirmed the accounts provided by eyewitnesses.\n\n**7. Sentencing Considerations:**\n\nIn determining the appropriate sentence for Y. Nelson, this court considered the frequency and seriousness of her actions, the resultant impact on public order, and the fact that she had previously been issued several warnings. Despite these warnings, the defendant continued her disruptive conduct unabated. The cumulative effect of her actions had a profound adverse impact on the community's peace and security.\n\nThe court also weighed the need for deterrence, both specific to the defendant and general to the public, to prevent similar future occurrences. The continued pattern of aggressive and provocative behavior indicated a lack of remorse and a disregard for community norms and legal requirements.\n\n**8. Judgment Result:**\n\nThis court finds the defendant, Y. Nelson, guilty of the Crime of Picking Quarrels and Provoking Trouble under Article No. 293 of the Criminal Code. Accordingly, Y. Nelson is sentenced to three years of fixed-term imprisonment.\n\nConsideration for probation was evaluated. However, given the recurring nature and escalation of the defendant's conduct despite previous warnings, suspension of the sentence or probation was deemed unsuitable for this case.\n\n**9. Appeal Rights Explanation:**\n\nThe defendant has the right to appeal this judgment. In accordance with the statutory provisions, if the defendant chooses to do so, the appeal must be filed within ten (10) days from the date of serving this judgment. The appeal should be submitted to the higher court through this court, specifying the grounds for appeal and the desired relief or outcome.\n\n**Verdict Delivered:**\n\nJune 10, 2023  \nGlenwood, Quailwood Court  \n\n*Chief Judge:* Hon. H. Ruiz  \n*Presiding Judge:* Hon. E. Collins  \n*Court Clerk:* K. Kelly\n\nReference Article is below：\nArticle 293\nAnyone who commits any of the following acts of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, disrupting social order, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years, criminal detention, or control:\n(a) Randomly beating others, with serious circumstances;\n(b) Chasing, intercepting, insulting, or intimidating others, with serious circumstances;\n(c) Forcibly taking or arbitrarily destroying or occupying public or private property, with serious circumstances;\n(d) Making trouble in a public place, causing serious disorder in the public place.\nIf one gathers others to repeatedly commit the aforementioned acts, seriously disrupting social order, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of more than five years but not more than ten years, and may also be fined.",

                "This court finds the defendant, Y. Nelson, guilty of the Crime of Picking Quarrels and Provoking Trouble under Article No. 293 of the Criminal Code.",
                "Accordingly, Y. Nelson is sentenced to three years of fixed-term imprisonment.",
                "In determining the appropriate sentence for Y. Nelson, this court considered the frequency and seriousness of her actions, the resultant impact on public order, and the fact that she had previously been issued several warnings.",
                "Despite these warnings, the defendant continued her disruptive conduct unabated.",
                "The cumulative effect of her actions had a profound adverse impact on the community's peace and security.",
                "However, given the recurring nature and escalation of the defendant's conduct despite previous warnings, suspension of the sentence or probation was deemed unsuitable for this case."
