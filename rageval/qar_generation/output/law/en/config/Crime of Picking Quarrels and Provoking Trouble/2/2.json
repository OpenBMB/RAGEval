Ruiz  \nJudge: R. Morales  \nClerk: X. Ruiz  \n\n**Defendant Information:**  \nName: J. Gonzalez  \nGender: Female  \nDate of Birth: 11th August, 1964  \nResidence: 93 Lakewood Street, Linden  \nEthnicity: Hispanic  \nOccupation: Unemployed  \n\n**Defense Lawyer Information:**  \nName: W. Watson  \nLaw Firm: Watson & Associates Law Firm  \n\n---\n\n**I. Case Procedures:**\n\nThis court, the Charleston, Linden, Court, commenced these criminal proceedings to adjudicate the case of the defendant, J.

The proceedings are based on the investigation and filing led by the Charleston, Linden, Procuratorate.\n\n1. **Case Filing and Investigation**  \nThe case was initially reported and subsequently filed for investigation on the 1st of January, 2023. Law enforcement authorities took initial statements, reviewed relevant surveillance footage, and interviewed witnesses to compile the necessary evidence.\n\n2. **Detention Measures Taken**  \nOn the 5th of January, 2023, preliminary detention measures were taken by the police to ensure the safety of the public and to prevent any potential interference with the ongoing investigation.\n\n3. **Criminal Detention**  \nThe defendant, J. Gonzalez, was formally placed under criminal detention on the 10th of January, 2023, following the gathering of substantial evidence hinting at her culpability in the disturbances reported.\n\n4. **Arrest**  \nA formal arrest was executed on the 15th of January, 2023, by order of the Charleston, Linden, Procuratorate, after the careful review of all the collected evidence and the determination that further holding J. Gonzalez was necessary to safeguard public order and ensure justice.\n\n---\n\n**II. Case Statement:**\n\nThis case concerns the recurrent criminal actions perpetrated by the defendant, J. Gonzalez, across various dates in December 2022. Through these actions, the defendant exhibited blatant disregard for the peace and safety of the community, engaging in behavior characterized by violence, threats, and property damage.\n\n1. **Incident on 10th December, 2022**  \nOn the afternoon of the 10th of December, 2022, between the hours of 15:00 to 15:30, the defendant, J. Gonzalez, approached an individual, Mr. John Smith, without any justifiable reason, while he was present at Central Park, Linden. Goading Mr. Smith into an altercation by shouting obscenities and using derogatory language, the confrontation escalated when the defendant physically assaulted Mr. Smith by pushing and striking him, resulting in minor injuries. This incident attracted the attention of several onlookers who subsequently provided witness testimonies aiding the investigation.\n\n2. **Incident on 12th December, 2022**  \nIn the early evening of the 12th of December, 2022, from 18:00 to 18:20, the defendant forcibly entered ‘GreenMart,’ a local grocery store on Elm Street. Claiming the store sold expired goods, she accused the store manager, culminating in a heated argument. The escalation of the confrontation led to her vandalizing the store, including knocking down shelves and damaging goods approximated at a value of $500. Store surveillance captured the entire episode, providing clear visual evidence of the destructive acts committed by the defendant.\n\n3. **Incident on 20th December, 2022**  \nOn the 20th of December, 2022, between 13:00 and 13:45, the defendant was found in the vicinity of Lakewood Street brandishing a metal rod and chasing a passerby, Mr. Robert Brown. This incident caused significant public alarm and disturbance, attracting the attention of numerous onlookers whose testimonies corroborated the aggressive and threatening behavior displayed by the defendant. Police were promptly called to quell the disturbance, and the entire incident was partially captured by surveillance cameras from a nearby shop.\n\n---\n\n**III. Charge:**\n\nThe defendant, J. Gonzalez, stands charged with the Crime of Picking Quarrels and Provoking Trouble pursuant to Article 293. The charge arises from the exhibited behavior involving initiating quarrels, provoking unnecessary confrontations, and causing public disturbances on multiple occasions.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Evidence Description:**\n\nIn arriving at a judgment, this court has meticulously reviewed the following evidence:\n\n1. **Witness Testimonies:**\n   - **Jane Doe and Mark Johnson** gave corroborative accounts of the defendant’s aggressive behavior and assault on Mr. John Smith at Central Park on the 10th of December, 2022. These testimonies were consistent and detailed, adding substantial weight to the case against the defendant.\n   - **Store Manager’s Statement** and statements from other staff and customers present at ‘GreenMart’ during the incident on the 12th of December, 2022, highlighted the unwarranted aggression and vandalism perpetrated by the defendant.\n   - **Anna Lee and Peter Clark** provided eye-witness accounts of the defendant chasing and intimidating Mr. Robert Brown with a metal rod near Lakewood Street on the 20th of December 2022. Their descriptions of the event matched the visual evidence obtained.\n\n2. **Medical Report:**  \nA medical report dated 11th December 2022, confirmed the physical injuries sustained by Mr. John Smith, directly linking them to the altercation with the defendant.\n\n3. **Surveillance Footage:**\n   - Footage timestamped between 15:05 to 15:30 on the 10th of December 2022, from Central Park, visually captured significant segments of the confrontation between the defendant and Mr. John Smith.\n   - Store surveillance footage dated the 12th of December 2022, clearly showed the defendant’s actions inside ‘GreenMart,’ including the destruction of property.\n   - Surveillance footage from a nearby shop on Lakewood Street on the 20th of December 2022 provided visual confirmation of the defendant's threatening behavior towards Mr. Robert Brown.\n\n4. **Damaged Goods Inventory and Receipts:**  \nAn inventory list and corresponding receipts detailed the extent of damage and the cost of repairs incurred by ‘GreenMart’ due to the defendant's actions.\n\n5. **Police Report:**  \nThe official police report dated 20th December 2022, recorded the statements of officers responding to the disturbance near Lakewood Street and detailed the facts surrounding the incident.\n\n---\n\n**V. Sentencing Considerations:**\n\nUpon evaluating the evidence and considering the defense's arguments, this court acknowledges several key factors influencing the sentencing decision:\n\n1. **Previous Record of Similar Offences:**  \nJ. Gonzalez has a documented history of similar disruptive and violent behavior, indicating a troubling pattern that necessitates a more stringent deterrent.\n\n2. **Nature and Impact of Crimes:**  \nThe offenses resulted in physical harm to individuals, significant distress to the public, and considerable property damage, reflecting a severe disruption to public order and safety.\n\n3. **Mental Health Evaluation:**  \nA mental health evaluation presented during the defense proceedings suggested the defendant might benefit from counseling post-imprisonment. While this is acknowledged, the nature and frequency of the offenses call for a custodial sentence to serve justice and public protection.\n\n---\n\n**VI. Judgment Result:**\n\nIn accordance with the laws governing this court, particularly in reference to Article 293, this court sentences the defendant, J. Gonzalez, to a fixed-term imprisonment of three (3) years for the Crime of Picking Quarrels and Provoking Trouble. The court also orders that, upon release, the defendant shall undergo mandatory counseling as prescribed by a certified mental health professional.\n\n---\n\n**VII. Appeal Rights Explanation:**\n\nThis court hereby informs the defendant, J. Gonzalez, that she retains the right to appeal this judgment in accordance with the legal provisions within the prescribed time limit. Should the defendant choose to contest this judgment, a formal appeal must be filed with the appellate court following the procedural guidelines stipulated by law.\n\n---\n\n**Court of Charleston, Linden:**\n\nChief Judge: T. Ruiz  \nJudge: R. Morales  \nCourt Clerk: X. Ruiz  \n\nDate: 1st March 2023\n\nReference Article is below：\nArticle 293\nAnyone who commits any of the following acts of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, disrupting social order, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years, criminal detention, or control:\n(a) Randomly beating others, with serious circumstances;\n(b) Chasing, intercepting, insulting, or intimidating others, with serious circumstances;\n(c) Forcibly taking or arbitrarily destroying or occupying public or private property, with serious circumstances;\n(d) Making trouble in a public place, causing serious disorder in the public place.\nIf one gathers others to repeatedly commit the aforementioned acts, seriously disrupting social order, they shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of more than five years but not more than ten years, and may also be fined.",
