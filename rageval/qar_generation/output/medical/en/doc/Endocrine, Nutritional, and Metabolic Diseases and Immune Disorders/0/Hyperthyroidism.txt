Preliminary Diagnosis:
Hyperthyroidism

Diagnostic Basis:
History of irritability, weight loss, palpitations, and heat intolerance; enlarged thyroid on physical exam; confirmed by elevated T4 and T3 levels and suppressed TSH on laboratory tests

Differential Diagnosis:
Destructive thyrotoxicosis ruled out by lack of inflammation signs; exogenous thyroid hormone intake not supported by patient history; simple goiter less likely due to symptom severity; hypothyroidism ruled out by hyperthyroid symptoms; hyperparathyroidism less likely due to lack of hypercalcemia

Admission Records:
