Admission Records:
Physician's Signature: Dr. J. Thompson

DiseaseType:
Malignant Tumors:
Name: Esophageal Malignancy
Symptoms: Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing or feeling of obstruction when food moves down the esophagus, initially for solid food, later for semi-solid food, and finally for liquid food and saliva, indicating a progressive malignant course rather than spasm, benign or digestive strictures); chest pain often radiating to the back.
Differential Diagnosis: Benign esophageal stricture, achalasia, esophageal diverticulum, esophageal tuberculosis, etc.
