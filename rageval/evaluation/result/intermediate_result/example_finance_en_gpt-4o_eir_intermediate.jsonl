By acquiring a major competitor, Energex was able to strengthen its market power. This increased market power likely allowed the company to exert greater influence over market prices and conditions, which can lead to higher revenue and profitability.\n\nSecondly, the acquisition resulted in an increased asset base (Doc 1).
