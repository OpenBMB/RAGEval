## Introduction

RAGEval is a novel framework designed for automatically generating evaluation datasets to assess the knowledge usage ability of different Large Language Models (LLMs) in various Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Unlike existing RAG benchmarks that focus on general knowledge, RAGEval enables the creation of domain-specific factual queries, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of RAG systems across different vertical domains.

## News
- **[2024/9/21]** We have released our article generation pipeline and 'query-answer-reference' generation pipeline
- **[2024/8/31]** We have released our evaluation method at the ``rageval/evaluation`` folder.
- **[2024/8/25]** We have released our DragonBall dataset at the ``dragonball_dataset`` folder. The RAGEval pipeline is coming soon!

## Key Features

1. üèóÔ∏è **Flexible Schema Generation**: Summarizes a schema from seed documents to capture domain-specific knowledge structures.

2. üîÑ **Diverse Document Generation**: Uses the schema to generate varied configurations and subsequently diverse documents across multiple domains.

3. ‚ùì **Comprehensive QA Pair Creation**: Constructs question-answering pairs based on generated documents and configurations.

4. üìä **Novel Evaluation Metrics**: Introduces three new metrics - Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance - for a more thorough assessment of RAG model responses.

5. üåê **Multi-Domain Support**: Covers various domains including finance, legal, and medical sectors in both Chinese and English languages.

## Components

1. **Schema Summary**: Extracts domain-specific knowledge structures from seed documents.
2. **Document Generation**: Creates diverse, factually rich documents based on the schema.
3. **QRA (Question-Reference-Answer) Generation**: Produces comprehensive evaluation triples.
4. **DRAGONBall Dataset**: A diverse RAG benchmark covering multiple domains and languages.
5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Novel metrics for assessing RAG system performance.


## Usage

- For Evaluation, please refer to [evaluation](https://github.com/OpenBMB/RAGEval/tree/main/rageval/evaluation)
- For Article Generation, please refer to [article_generation](https://github.com/OpenBMB/RAGEval/tree/main/rageval/article_generation)
- For QAR Generation, please refer to [QAR_generation](https://github.com/OpenBMB/RAGEval/tree/main/rageval/qar_generation)

## Experiments

RAGEval has been used to benchmark various LLMs and RAG configurations:

- Compared performance of 9 popular open/closed-source generation models
- Evaluated different retrieval models (BM25, GTE-Large, BGE-Large, BGE-M3)
- Analyzed impact of hyperparameters like TopK retrieval and chunk size

## Results

- GPT-4o showed the best overall performance, but open-source models like Llama3-8B-Instruct demonstrated competitive results.
- Language-specific optimization in retrieval models proved crucial for performance.
- Hyperparameter tuning revealed important trade-offs between retrieval accuracy and generation quality.

## Conclusion

RAGEval provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating RAG systems in domain-specific scenarios, offering more nuanced insights than existing benchmarks. It highlights the potential for significant improvements in open-source models for RAG tasks.
